# annaRoom
 
This page features a collaborative work by Nitzan Shafran and Anna Disse;
The it first came to live in Lisbon, Portugal in 2021 and soon moved to Jerusalem, Israel.

Rather then a 3D recreation, we chose to show the trailer and the sound. The viewer enters a waiting room and receives instructions for the installation as well as head phones. The viewer is alone with Anna in the installation and is free to explore it accompanied by a meditation through the headphones.
